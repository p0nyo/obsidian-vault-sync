	- Mechanism that is designed to detect, prevent or recover from a security attack

### Types of Security Attacks
- **Passive**
	1. Release of message content - intercepting messages
	2. Traffic Analysis - looking at the metadata
		- E.g how many packets, how often

		- Impersonating people to send messages
		- Steal IP from Bob
	2. Replay
		- Receiving message and relaying it

	4. Denial of Service (DOS)
		- Attacking and disabling the server, users can't use the service, overwhelm the server
### Security Services
1. **Authentication**
	- Process to verify yourself
2. **Access Control (Authorisation)**
	- A technique used to regulate access to resources
3. **Confidentiality**
	- Protection of data
4. **Data integrity**
	- Ensuring received data is not tampered with
5. **Non-repudiation**
	- Protection against people denying they did something
6. **Availability**
	- System always available to legit users

### Security Mechanisms
1. **Encryption**
	- Encrypting messages
2. **Digital Signature**
	- Something to help validate authenticity
3. **Access Control**
	- Enforcing access rights
4. **Notarisation**
	- Using trusted party to assure data exchange
5. **Password**
