###### Four P's of Software Development
1. People
	- *By whom it is done*
	- Anybody who has interest or is related to the software
2. Products
	- *The artifacts produced*
	- Anything that is produced
3. Process
	- *The manner it is done*
	- The strategy that is used to complete the software
	- The process is a template for creating projects
4. Project
	- *The task at hand*
	- The overall management of the project
		- E.g Planning, Marketing, Budgeting

#### Generic Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
1. **Communication**
	- Gathering Requirements (Between stakeholder <-> team)
		- What needs to be done
		- How it is going to be implemented
		- How to test once implemented
2. **Planning**
	- Plan for software engineering work, addresses:
		- Technical tasks
		- Resource allocation
		- Cost estimation
		- Work schedule
3. **Modelling**
	- Creation of models to understand the requirements and design
	2. Analyse
		- Analysing the requirements
	3. Design
		- Creating a design based off of the requirements
4. **Construction**
	- Coding and testing to uncover errors
	- Must be done in parallel (Coding + Testing)
5. **Deployment**
	- Delivery of software to the stakeholder/customer
